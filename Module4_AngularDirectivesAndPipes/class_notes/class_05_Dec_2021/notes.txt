/// Directives: 
    -> Used to manipulate the DOM
    -> control sections on the screen
    -> JS + HTML (optional)
    -> usage in HTML templates

    Types of Directives:

    (1) Components: they are also directives
        -> Components can be reused
        -> Components can manipulate the DOM

    (2) Structural Directives: Alter the structure of DOM
            -> Add more elements
            -> delete elements
            -> replace elements

            e.g.
                -> *ngIf : conditionally adds/removes the elements from the DOM
                -> *ngFor : used to generate more elements on the DOM after iterating over a collection of data
                -> [ngSwitch] : based on multiple conditions, you can manipulate the DOM
                

    (3) Attribute Directives:
        -> only modify the appearance of the HTML elements
        -> do not add or remove new HTML elements on the DOM
        -> e.g.
            -> [ngClass] : it can apply css classes conditionally
            -> [ngStyles] : it can apply inline css styles conditionally
            

    (4) Custom directives: 
        -> user defined structural directives are possible
        -> user defined Attribute directives are possible



//// ng-template   vs   ng-container

    -> both are used to group the elements together 
    -> without having the need to introduce newer elements which will be rendered on the page
    -> ng-template : reusability
    -> ng-container : nest multiple structural directives, then  we use ng-container


/// custom directive: 
    -> when you take your mouse over an element, it gets highlighted
    -> when you take away your mouse from the element, it goes back to normal

    Events:
        -> mouseenter
        -> mouseleave
    
    HostListener
        -> decorator to refer the element on which the interaction is going to happen

    ElementRef
        -> it provides a reference to the element on which we apply the directive



///// Pipes:

    -> used to format the appearance of any HTML element
    -> can only be used in the HTML templates
    -> while interpolation the pipe has the ability to format the output before it can be displayed on the screen
    -> pipes do not change the underlying data, they only modify the appearance of the data


    Types of pipes:

        (1) in-built pipes:
            - strings
            - number
            - currency
            - date
            - json

        (2) custom pipes: user-defind pipes

            example:
            I need to filter a list of students based on the grades secured by them



Pure and Impure Pipes:
