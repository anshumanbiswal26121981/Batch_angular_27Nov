//// Data Binding: Communication between template and the component class



/// Component Interaction

Parent to child ->
    - from parent component we will do a property binding
    - @Input() in the child component

Child to Parent ->
    - @Output in the child component
    - EventEmitter in the component: emit the values from the child component towards the parent component
    - event binding in the parent component


//// What is Animation ???

    - illusion of movement
    - created with a number of images put together in a quick succession

    - angular animation will directly use the CSS concepts
        - need to be clear with advanced concepts of CSS (Cascsding style sheet)


    TO create animations in Angular:
        (1) Import Browser ANimations module in the app.module
        (2) Create some animations
            - you must be good with CSS
            - 4 small functionalities
        (3) link / attach the animations in the component
            - remember some sytax


    example: moving ball



//// Lifecycle hooks 

    -> lifecycle of component

   import { onInit } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
       selector: ''
       templateUrl: ''
       styleUrls: []
   })
   export class User implements onInit {

       constructor() {
           // get called on the initialisation
       }

       ngOninit() {
           // ready for usage
           // we can make API calls to fetch the data, set some configurations
       }

       ngOnChanges() {
           // gets executed whenever the bindings change in the component
       }

       ngAfterViewInit() {
           // gets executed after the component renders on the DOM
       }

       ngDoCheck() {
           // gets executed whenever we trigger change in the component
       }

       ngOnDestroy() {
           // when the component is removed from the DOM
       }

   }
